# Next.js 12 React Server Components Demo (Alpha)

Try the demo live here: [**next-rsc-hn.vercel.app**](https://next-rsc-hn.vercel.app).

## Introduction

This is a demo app of the Hacker News website clone, which shows Next.js 12's experimental React Server Components support. We recommend you taking a look at these links, before trying out the experimental feature:
- [**Introducing Zero-Bundle-Size React Server Components**](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html)
- [**Everything About React Server Components**](https://vercel.com/blog/everything-about-react-server-components)
- [**Docs of React Server Components in Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/react-18#react-server-components)

This demo is built for showing what features that Server Components provide and what the application structure might look like. **It's not ready for production adoption, or performance benchmarking** as the underlying APIs are not stable yet, and might change or be improved in the future.

## Technical Details

This Next.js application uses React 18 (RC build) and the new [Edge Runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/edge-runtime). It has `runtime` set to `'edge'` and feature flag `serverComponents` enabled. You can check out [next.config.js](https://github.com/vercel/next-rsc-demo/blob/main/next.config.js) for more details.
